Revolutionizing Heart Disease Diagnosis: Ensemble and Blending-Based Detection Models
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Early accurate diagnosis of Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
 has become important considering their increasing prevalence and high
 mortality rate. This paper presents an innovative deep learning-based
 approach for heart disease prediction, employing two ensemble frame
works: EnsCVDD-Net and BlCVDD-Net. Utilizing a dataset of 4,00,000
 samples available on Kaggle, this research explores the combined effec
tiveness of LeNet and GRU models within the ensemble networks. Re
sults demonstrate that both proposed models surpass traditional models,
 with EnsCVDD-Net achieving an accuracy of 90%, while BlCVDD-Net,
 blending LeNet, GRU, and MLP, also achieved 91% accuracy, outper
forming both standalone LeNet and GRU models. EnsCVDD-Net exhib
ited optimal performance in the detection of CVDs, validated through
 various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The pro
posed models utilize Adaptive Synthetic Sampling for data balancing and
 SHAP for model interpretability, providing insights into feature contri
butions. This proposal focus on the effectiveness of the ensemble learning
 models in improving prediction accuracy and holds promise for practical
 applications in early cardiovascular disease detection.

  Models
  -------------
  This study evaluates different deep learning models to predict cardio
vascular disease :
 
 A. LENET:
 LeNet was one of the first CNNs designed with the aim of image
 recognition and in particular, recognition of handwritten digits.It is made up of
 the convolutional network layers, Pooling layers as well as fully connected layers
 that forms the basis of modern deep learning architectures.
 
 B. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) : 
 This is a type of RNN, is imple
mented to process the sequential data by learning dependencies over time, mak
ing it effective for capturing temporal patterns within the dataset .
 
 C. BlCVDD-Net:
 A blending-based model combining LeNet, GRU, and a
 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a metalayer. It leverages the strengths of CNNs
 for feature extraction and RNNs for sequence learning, followed by an MLP to
 aggregate and finalize predictions.
 
 D. EnsCVDD-Net:
 An ensemble model that integrates the outputs of
 LeNet and GRU.This model combines both CNN andRNNapproaches, allowing
 it to better generalize over diverse patterns in the dataset

  Conclusion and Future Work
  ------------------------------------------------------
 This work highlights the success of deep learning, specifically ensemble and
 blending methods, in heart disease prediction. BlCVDD-Net had a better per
formance of 91% and EnsCVDD-Net a performance of 90%. Convolutional and
 recurrent layer combinations helped the models capture sophisticated spatial
 and temporal relationships and, hence, made more accurate predictions.
 Future work would be to increase the dataset in order to encompass het
erogenous populations, use advanced feature engineering, and utilize deep trans
fer learning to make the model more efficient. Enabling interpretability through
 the usage of SHAP or LIME could also ensure clinical uptake due to feature
 attribution insights. Increasingly complex ensemble learning approaches can po
tentially make diagnostics even more accurate and robust within heart disease
 identification systems
